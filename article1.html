  <p style="width: 100%;padding: 20px;background: papayawhip;">In this digital age, it is really important to learn skills that enable one to easily navigate the 21st century. Our Zambian education system lags behind in terms of digital skills training. I attended public school throughout my life and the closest I came to learning anything to do with computers was in secondary school where I had a subject “Computer Studies” and all I remember learning were parts of a computer set i.e monitor, mouse, Keyboard… I’m pretty sure you get the picture… I attended tertiary education and still didn’t encounter much of digital training either.<br> After graduation, I faced the reality of job hunting and always experienced the ‘Imposter Syndrome’ where I felt I wasn’t going to be good enough for any job because my skillset was limited. I always felt like I’d easily fall short at any job because I felt under-trained and, of course, inexperienced. That was until I came across tutorials on YouTube on computer programming. I used all the time I had to learning all I could for the following reasons which I reflected upon each time I needed to remind myself why I was learning everything I could about computers.
